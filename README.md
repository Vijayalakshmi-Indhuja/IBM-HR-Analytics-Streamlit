## 📊 IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs and loss of experienced talent.
This project analyzes employee data from a fictional IBM HR dataset to identify key factors influencing employee attrition and provides an interactive dashboard along with a machine learning model to predict attrition risk.

The solution is built end-to-end using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, and Machine Learning, and is deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze overall employee attrition rate

2. Identify key attrition drivers such as:

		- Work-life balance

		- Overtime

		- Department

		- Job role

3. Visualize HR insights using an interactive dashboard

4. Build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition

5. Deploy the solution for real-time access

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

1. Python

2. Pandas, NumPy

3. Matplotlib, Seaborn

4. Scikit-learn

5. Jupyter Notebook

6. Streamlit

7. GitHub

8. Streamlit Cloud (Deployment)

## 📊 Key Insights

1. Overall attrition rate: ~16%

2. Higher attrition observed among:

	- Employees with poor work-life balance

	- Employees working overtime

	- Certain job roles and departments (e.g., Sales)

3. Average employee tenure before leaving: ~7 years

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

**Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier

**Goal**: Predict whether an employee is likely to leave

**Features**: Numeric HR attributes such as age, income, job level, tenure, and work-life balance

**Output**: Attrition risk prediction (Yes / No)

## 🌐 Streamlit Dashboard Features

1. Overall attrition KPI

2. Interactive filters (Department, Gender)

3. Attrition analysis by:

	 3.1 Gender

	 3.2 Work-life balance

	 3.3 Department

	 3.4 Job role

4. Attrition prediction form using ML model
